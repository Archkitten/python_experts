        Hello Agent G1. You were never Agent G1. Agent G1 has been gone for quite a while now.<br>
        I've laid the path for you to find this message, and end this once and for all.

        This command doesn't just turn off the system. It will destroy it, for this cursed terminal to never see the light of day again.<br>
        There's nowhere left to go. You'll be fine of course. But there will finally be peace for all of us, after this ends.<br>
        Goodbye, user. Thank you for playing.
