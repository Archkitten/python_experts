### Peer Video Reviews
| Name | Comment |
| ---  | ---      |
| Tyler Hickman | William Wu: I really liked how you explained how important your leadership job is. I agree with you that the key to collaboration is good leadership, which you demonstrated. You demonstrated your knowledge of if else statements in your logic gates. It made your code effective and is perfect for lazy coders. I loved how you inputted a gray scale as a subsitutue for gray scale. It's very unique and clever. One suggestion I have is to format your logic gate user interface a bit better. I understand why you inputted tables but I believe there is a better approach. In my opionion, the logic gate page is too spread out. I think you can use the space better. Overewall, great job and wonderful video! <br> Aidan Wu: I think you did a great job explaining how you managed our team well. Your idea to split the logic gates into two groups on the scrumboard was a very good idea to make work more effecient. Your for loop also definitely made everything easier, helping us become lazy programmers. Finally, the logic gate code was great, being able to select inputs for a and b, and using tables to format the page wasn't a bad idea either. However, I think the visual appeal could have been better. The black font color didn't fit well with the background and makes the text harder to see. A way to fix this would be to change the background for that page specifically, change the font color, or add a highlight/background color for just the table. <br> Ticket <br> Ticket |
| William Wu | Aidan Wu: I think you showed did a good job showing how the collaboration on the slides had a very good effect on our website, seeing that our website did follow the slides pretty closely. For example, the about pages and the games pages being really similar to the slides. I think you also did very well showing the code for shifting left or right, so we know how shifting works. The conditionals in the code for Tic Tac Toe definitely showed your understanding of conditionals, for example with long conditionals that was shown for how the website decides when a player wins.. I think the layout for Tic Tac Toe was very well thought out. I liked how the Reset button in the page was blue with round edges, making it actually look like something part of a game, which is the whole point of our website. One thing you could work on would be that when player X or player O wins, the final X or O is actually displayed on the Tic Tac Toe board. <br> Ticket <br> Ticket <br> Ticket |
| Arch Huang | William Wu: Very clever how you used conditional variables and a event listen to detect when a key was pressed. I found it really unique that you could intereact with the music. Your demonstration was AMAZING. You explained the code very well and I liked how you put text of what keys you were pressing to make your deomonstartion easier to follow. Your implementation of lables and checkboxes helps organize all our roles and duties so that we can all collaborate better. One suggestion I have is to add some instructions on your blackscreen music game to help the user know what is going on. Overall, amazing job Arch! <br> Aidan Wu: I think that you did a great job showing how you resolved the issue you ran into while doing deloyment by actually show us the page where you found the solution with the command you needed to fix it "sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev". I also think that you adding the mario sound track along with its respective key in the game was a very nice addition, making it more game-like. For examples, the key w played the jump sound effect. Finally, I think the checkboxes and the labels you added to the scrumboard was very useful, since it allowed to easily see which tasks we have completed and which ones we still have to work on. One thing to work on would be to change the navbar (only on this page) to also incoropate the blackscreen style by changing its white background black and changing the text into white (somewhat like dark mode). <br> Ticket <br> Ticket |

## **Sprint 5,6 week 5**
**Theme: Every Scrum Team needs to integrate "RGB Values with an Image" to their project.**

> Requirements
- [ ] **Arch + Aidan** RGB Values with an Image, Frontend... how would you change to grey scale dynamically?  Look for Hack in code.

- [x] **Tyler + William + David** RGB Values with an Image, Backend... how would you write a message into image (Links to an external site.) and transport it to the Web?  Look at Pillow Image write in Tester.

- [ ] **Arch + Aidan** RGB Values with an Image, New Development.  explore and implement a new possibility in manipulating images (Links to an external site.).

- [ ] **Arch + Aidan** RGB Values with an Image, Backend... image files are really big, this would make a Programmer consider being efficiency in programming.  What are the calculations?  Could the image.py function "def image_data" more efficient?  There is a science to writing efficient algorithms called Big O notation (Links to an external site.). Write image_data function to be more efficient according to Big O notation.

- [x] **William + David + Tyler** Research/Study sheet/journal.  what is base2, base8, base16.  what is base64?   How is base64 different? what are some ideas from this research that you can use in your PBL project?  Add backlog items.

- ### **Complete TPT Activities**
- [x] Scrum/Pair activity.  Listen to OO's and TO's introduction.  Write about OOs' and TOs roles in your journal.  Brainstorm on how you think fellow student can help you in Test Prep.  Review idea with Scrum Team, then review again with Crossover team.  Each Scrum Team create summary and provide ideas to OO's.
  
- [x] Scrum/Pair activity and journal. Unit 3.1 work.   Follow instructions and guidance from OO's
  
- [x] Scrum/Pair activity and journal. Unit 3.2 work.   Follow instructions and guidance from OO's

- [x] Continue planning best practice, be prepared for review during class on Wednesday, for points.


- Developers.
- [x] Ensure each person has Prototype and/or TT3 hack coding task.  TT3 Binary Math must be included in project with all "Hack" suggestions.  Duplicating a Hack task for multiple individuals and integrating into their personal page(s), would be wise for someone who is behind on code commits. **Everyone** needs code commits.


- Designer.
- [x] Ensure there is a Design or Research asset for prototyping work.


- Navigator/Tester.

> Prototyping and Research

- Team Designer/Coder pair.  Prototype layout.  Get your own STYLE, COLORS, FONTS; get your basic groove into your site.  Create these elements.  This should be consider CSS or <"style"> for your site.
- [x] [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/defaulT.asp) can provide guidance on CSS..
- [x] Experiment with Two themes...  Try a couple of prototype experiments and get feedback from Crossover.


- Team Designer/Coder pair.  Create location for Mini-labs, you could rename this to something for your team (aka How-its-Made, Concepts, etc).  This can have research or early concepts from your team.   Additionally this section should have embeds to Brain Write, Wireframes, Greet, and TPT3.  Evidence of research or early design. Try3x3 or 4x4 design on page.
- [x] [Bootstrap Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) layout is a suggested technical option.


- Individual Coding.   Review and update you home pages again.  Make sure you have a wireframe that can be linked to from your home page that shows design.  Review embedding and design concept [here](https://padlet.com/jmortensen7/embedding)


- Individual Research.   [Learn about binary](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/103/home?unit=2)  (Links to an external site.)this week through TPT and TT.  Also, review related videos on CB and Harvard Video.  Update journal, be ready to work on Binary lab next week.
